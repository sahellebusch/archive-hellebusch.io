# My First Post!

If I've learned anything from my first few years as a developer, it's that I can retain half as much of the information as I'd like, and I know less than half of what I need to know in order to be the engineer that I want to be. It's the small things that matter in life, and I like to think that applies to software engineering as well. If I could remember all the little nuainces such as testing promise rejections correctly using the mocha testing framework without false positives, or how to convert the ridiculous number of string types in Microsoft C++ back and forth without leaking memory, I'd be way ahead of where I'd like to be.

After 3.5 years of trying to figure out my note taking ecosystem, from napkin scribbles, to a versioned markdown repository, I can say that I've learned, once again, that the best way to remember things is to write and teach it. So in response to my own inner dialogue, and the numerous times end up kicking myself for not doing this years ago, I've set up this ...blog? to write about some of the nuainces that most people won't care about.  But that's okay, I'm honestly not doing it for you, the reader.  It's mostly for myself anyways. 

Anyways, enjoy.  Maybe you'll find something useful.  

Cheers :beers:
