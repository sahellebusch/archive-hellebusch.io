Iâ€™m Sean, a software engineer, avid backpacker, novice photographer, improv cook, and disc golf enthusiast. I grew up in Saint Louis, Missouri and attended college at Truman State University. After migrating to Kansas City for work, and meeting my wonderful partner, Kelly, we picked up our things and headed to the Pacific Northwest. Portland is where we call home now; where the beards grow long, the beer flows hazy, and the trees are ever green.

I currently work at moovel, NA, where we work to make cities smarter with a vision of becoming the operating system for urban mobility around the world.
